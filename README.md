Just like [1D ECA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) where we stack 1D states of the world one after another, representing a temporal dimension, this will be stacking 0D worlds, creatings 1D image in the end.

Again just like in 1D each cell has its "neighborhood", in 0D it consists of only 1 cell. For **n** states there exists **n^1** possible neighborhood states and **(n^1)!** possible rules. So go and explore all of them I guess...?

Also interesting properties of those rules, they are all reversible just like [Critters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critters_(cellular_automaton)) or this [1D version](https://optozorax.github.io/p/invertible-1d-automata/).
